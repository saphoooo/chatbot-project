# chatbot-project

## Purpose

This is a tiny bot project running on localhost (or on any machine).
The goal is to have your own personal assistant to discover the features of the bots, without having to do it with a developer account on a social network.
The chat app uses some code from Mat Ryer [Book](https://github.com/matryer/goblueprints), thaks to him to be so inspiring (an sorry for the quality of my code sometimes).

## How to use this code

Clone the repo on your local machine ; then build chat and bot. Run each one in a different terminal and enjoy!
