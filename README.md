# chatbot-project

## Purpose

This is a tiny bot project running on localhost (or on any machine).
The goal is to have your own personal bot to discover the capabilities of bots, without having to do it with a developer account on a social network.
The chat app uses some code from Mat Ryer [Book](https://github.com/matryer/goblueprints), thanks to him to be so inspiring (an sorry for the quality of my code sometimes :-)).

Obviously, at the moment this bot proposes a fallback by default, its goal being that you enrich it to make your own experiments. This is only a base and in no way a bot with any use: it's up to you!

## How to use this code

Clone the repo on your local machine ; then build chat and bot. Run each one in a different terminal and enjoy!

```
$ cd chat
$ go build -o chat
$ ./chat
$ cd bot # on a different terminal
$ go build -o bot
$ ./bot
```
